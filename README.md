# Cloud-to-Butt - xkcd Edition - Opera 15+

Derived from the work of Steven Frank's [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) Chrome extension, Randall Munroe's XKCD #1288, and a facebook conversation regarding airport security overreacharound. Now also available for Chrome, to get those monkeys off my back.


## Installing

1. Download [CloudToButtXKCDEditionOpera.nex](https://github.com/woodsj/cloud-to-butt-xkcd-opera15/releases/download/3.14159/cloud-to-butt-xkcd-edition-opera15.nex) or [c2b-xkcd.crx](https://github.com/woodsj/cloud-to-butt-xkcd-opera15/releases/download/3.14159/c2b-xkcd.crx) if you're using Chrome
2. Drag-n-Drop the file into Opera (or Chrome, if you're into that sort of thing).
3. You'll get a message at the top of the window informing you that the extension has been disabled because it's from an unknown source. Click the Go button at the top right to go to the Extension Manager
4. Install the extension
5. Win at life!


## Building

1. Download the code.
2. Create a new folder. Inside of it, place: manifest.json, index.html, and cloud-to-butt.js
3. Open Opera 15 or later. In the address bar type: about:extensions (or use keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+e)
4. Click the Developer Mode button, then the Load Unpacked Extension... button
5. Select the folder you created in step 2. This should load the extension.
6. Click Pack Extension and select the same folder. This will create two files: one .nex and one .pem. The .nex file is the extension.
7. This process is more or less the same in Chrome.
8. Enjoy!
